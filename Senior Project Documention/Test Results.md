| **1. Unit Testing**    | Test individual models, controllers, and helpers in isolation.                                | **Completed**    | All models and controllers passed validation and CRUD operations.                              |
| **2. Integration Testing** | Test the interactions between different components of the system (e.g., parent-child relationship, check-in process). | **In Progress**  | Parent-child association and check-in workflows passed; some minor optimizations identified.   |
